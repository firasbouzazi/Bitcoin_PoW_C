# Project Name
Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Prototype with C

## Description
This project is a prototype implementation of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm using the C programming language. The goal of the project is to provide a simple and efficient way to demonstrate the basic concepts of the proof-of-work algorithm in practice.

## Requirements
C compiler (e.g. GCC)
## Installation
1-Clone the repository to your local machine.
2-Navigate to the project directory.
3-Compile the source code using the C compiler.
## Usage
The program will start mining for a valid hash. Once a valid hash is found, it will be displayed on the screen along with the corresponding block header data.
